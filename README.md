# SARBUnity

Network client to connect to TCP sockets to receive and send data.

Bug fix:
Server and Client works now. Not sure what the issue was to be honest . I am going to guess it was just one simple error, and we tried to many thing. And the code got messy.
I just copied some of the c++ client code i had on linux, and just merged it in with yours. Seems it worked out fine. Remember to always close the sockets. :3 
Bug_fix branch has a working unity client with the server. 
 
Simple code is the best code :D. Sorry for the this.member statement. old habits.

Not sure how the client will work if you start adding a game around it, but maybe just put the whole network script in its own thread
and it should be fine. yeah And the latest update on master had the same issue as previously.
